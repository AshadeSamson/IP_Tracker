- [express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - Node.js framework







### What I learned

Though I started the project as a frontend-based project, but the need to abstract my API keys from the browser led me to learning about how a backend can help me out.
I learnt about server side renedering(SSR) and static site generation(SSG) using Node.js and it's Express.js framework.







### Useful resources

- [ipify.org](https://api.ipify.org) - Helped to capture the user's ip. really a nice feature.
- [Coding Train YT channel](https://youtu.be/DbcLg8nRWEg) - This YT series really helped in explaining how to work with APIs and connect backend and frontend codes in javascript.
